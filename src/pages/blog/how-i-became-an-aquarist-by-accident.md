One fine evening as I was walking off my office complex, right outside the gate I saw a vendor selling fisheS in a bowl. I capitalised the S(knowing very well fishe-s isn't the actual plural of fish, rather more of an adapted word) to emphasize the amount. While I wasn't an expert in fish keeping, I knew very well keeping four fishes in a 15cm(6 inch) bowl isn't a good idea. So I decide to buy it and give it away to a local pet store. I was surprised by the price as they were asking for mere â‚¹200 (about 2.5$) for 4 fishes along with a bowl and fish food! So I buy it and head for the local pet store only to find that it's closed. I had no other option rather than to take it home for the night, and that's where it all began.

Reaching home I looked up online forums to find the 4 fish were:

* 1 Shubunkin Goldfish
* 1 Comet Goldfish 
* 1 Kissing Gourami 
* 1 Iridescent Shark 

Although all the fishes were juvenile none were meant to be kept in a bowl, I set up an old bucket to give them space to swim. I'm assuming the fish were stolen from some shipment, because none of them were cheap fishes. By the morning tragedy struck, Shark was the fish one to go, followed by the Comet. Even though I had them only for a night I was already in love with them! Their death moved me, and I was already slipping form my original intentions of re-homing them. I went and bought a 120L(about 30 gallons) capacity fish tank with moulded corners. And ordered a filter from my Prime (same day delivery). By the time filter and the tank arrived It was time for Shubunkin to go. The thing about Kissing Gourami is that, calling them hardy fish would be an understatement. They can survive in any condition, and were fortunately, perfect choice for fish-in cycling. My tank cycled within 3 weeks. I guess it must be because my location being a tropical country.

Countless Youtube Videos, Online Research, Shopping, Scaping, days later, I have 5 fishes. Now I'm so into the hobby that I can't imagine living without the fishes. I wouldn't still call me an expert as I still make mistakes, like getting unsuitable fishes, introducing fishes that haven't been quarantined etc.

So that's the story of how I became an Aquarist by accident!
