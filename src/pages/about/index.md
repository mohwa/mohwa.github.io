This aims to be a place where I can publish anything and everything that interests me. This can range from science and technology to entertainment.

As you may have already guessed, this blog's name is inspired by the famous pub in _Harry Potter_. Just like that pub this blog will be a magical place where all random interesting things meet.

This is a place where I want to share the challenges that I have faced in my 20 odd years. I will also show you how I overcame them so that others, who may be going through the same won't have go through them alone.

Being a travel enthusiast, I really want this blog to be a place where you can get to know about the mysteries and stories of the world. It has been well established that I have a varied interest, so I will also sporadically post movie, music and event reviews.

Occasionally, this blog will feature guest writers who will write about what they truly love. I hope to bring to light various unique world views to really live up to my blog's name.

All in all this, blog has no fixed scope because _"True Beauty Lies In Chaos"_.

I sincerely hope this blog helps and inspires people to overcome their challenges, learn new things and make their lives better.

As they say, life's a journey and I want us to support each other through each passing day.
